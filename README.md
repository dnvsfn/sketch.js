## About

Sketch.js is a Javascript API for in interacting with canvas object. The
API's focus is to provide easy-to-use methods for rapidly developing canvas
"sketches". The name "Sketch.js" is not intended to represent drawing,
illustration, or any visual context, but rather borrows from
[Processing's](http://processing.org) concept of programs being sketches.

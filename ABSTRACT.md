# Abstract

## Origin

  Sketch.js started as a personal JS library for creating canvas experiments
  in the browser. The early version is a hacked together _(not working in 
  some areas)_ prototype specific to the `examples` sketches. 
  
  The early version is archived in the `early-version` git branch for reference.
  
  The first prototype of Sketch.js was started in August 2011, was slowly worked on
  for about a month, than put on the back burner to pursue other projects to 
  strengthen my JS skills in building what was becoming a fairly complex project.
  
  Over the last 5 months I've developed JS workflow I'm comfortable with, written
  a handful of npm modules, and studied numerous design patterns. Finally feeling
  comfortable with my toolkit, I am committed to this project again and hope to 
  share it in the open as soon as it's mature enough.

## Inspiration

  Much of Sketch.js is directly inspired by [Processing](http://processing.org/)
  by way of [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) and the API borrows heavily 
  from [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org) / [Scriptographer](http://scriptographer.org).
  
  Sketch.js would not be possible without all of these awesome projects. Each of
  which has been a invaluable tool in learning computational drawing, programming
  animation, and experimentation badassery.
  
  The turning point in forming Sketch.js as a project came from attending
  [Eye Festival 2011](http://eyefestival.com). At the current time _(June 2011)_
  I had taken a year long break from programming entirely to focus on 
  illustration, design, and general creative arts. Feeling revived and totally
  inspired by this game changing conference, I reentered my interest in programming
  and began gather the resources in creating JS Canvas library.

## Objective

  In its current state, Sketch.js is intended for nothing other than general 
  experimentation with the html canvas element.
  
  Near-future versions will support the same _(or similarly refined)_ 
  Sketch.js API for generating images via 
  [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas).
